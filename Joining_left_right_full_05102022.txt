SELECT * FROM presidents;

Joining two tables using ON clause
SELECT p1.country, p1.continent,
prime_minister, president
FROM prime_ministers AS p1
INNER JOIN presidents AS p2
ON p1.country = p2.country;

#Joining table on country using USING clause. this works when both tables have the same column name
SELECT p1.country, p1.continent,
prime_minister, president
FROM presidents AS p1
INNER JOIN prime_ministers AS p2
USING (country);

-- #Using Left join
SELECT p1.country, prime_minister, president
FROM prime_ministers AS p1
LEFT JOIN presidents AS p2
ON p1.country = p2.country;

#Using Right join
SELECT p1.country, prime_minister, president
FROM prime_ministers AS p1
RIGHT JOIN presidents AS p2
ON p1.country = p2.country;

#Using full join
SELECT p1.country AS pm_co, p2.country AS pres_co, prime_minister, president
